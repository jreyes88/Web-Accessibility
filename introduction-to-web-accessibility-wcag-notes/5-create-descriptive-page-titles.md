# Create Descriptive Page Titles

A descriptive webpage title is created using the `<title></title>` element.


The way the title text is written is crucial to helping users understand a site.


The text description contained in the `<title></title>` element is announced by the screen reader when the page is loaded, or when the user is navigating between tabs.


## Page Title Basics

A page title must:
- be descriptive to help a user understand the page content from the title text alone
- be concise. It acts as a hint to allow the user to understand what the page contains


## Multi-step Page Titles

Pages that are part of a multi-stage sequence can use the title to reflect the current step of the whole process.
- Therein lies a difficulty here though. If they navigate to these steps from within the site, there is prior contextual knowledge. But if they head to a "Step 1" page from within a bookmark, there's no context and the title may no longer be clear when read on its own.


Title page can be enhanced with added text, for example: "Step 2 - Online Ordering ACME Fashion House"


You can also append the website name to the end of each page title, so the user is aware of the page title, along with the website name.
