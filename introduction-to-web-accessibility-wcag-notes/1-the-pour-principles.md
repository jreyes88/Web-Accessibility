# The POUR Principles

- There are four principles which categorize the guidelines for web content accessibility, abbreviated as POUR:
    + Perceivable
    + Operable
    + Understandable
    + Robust

- These principles make it quick to find relevant accessibility guidelines.
- The categories can be thought of as a guide to show only the accesibility criteria for specific content.
    + Example: Making text content accessibility does not require meeting the criteria for making video content accessibile.
- For every guideline there are one or more individual success criteria
- Within each success criteria are several situations and techniques describing when the success criteria can be applied


## Perceive

- Ensures content isn't just displayed in one way, but alternative ways to be interpreted.
- There are four guidelines grouped under the __Perceive__ principle.
- These principles are intended to apply techniques in such a way that the user can understand the content.
- Guidelines:
    + __Guideline 1.1__ - non-text content has a text alternative
    + __Guideline 1.2__ - video and audio have accessibility alternatives
    + __Guideline 1.3__ - the underlying structure of content is robust and it can be presented in different ways
    + __Guideline 1.4__ - the content can be easily separated from the background
- An image:
    + Can only be understood by sighted people.
    + Adding a text alternative using the ALT attribute provides a description which can be interpreted in a non-visual way.
    + Applicable Guideline = __Guideline 1.1__ - non-text content has a text alternative.
    + Applicable Success Criteria = __Success Criteria 1.1.1 Non-text Content__ - all non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose.
        * This specific success criteria does list several situations that are exempt from providing the text alternative, as well as sufficient techniques that pass the success criteria, and known failures.


## Operable

- Ensures the content can be operated.
    + It can be operated from the keyboard as well as the mouse,
    + It doesn't cause seizures,
    + Waypoints are provided to help users understand where they are in the content.
- Guidelines:
    + __Guideline 2.1__ - make all functionality available from a keyboard
    + __Guideline 2.2__ - provide users enough time to read and use content
    + __Guideline 2.3__ - do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures
    + __Guideline 2.4__ - provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are
    + __Guideline 2.5__ - users can operate content through a variety of input devices


## Understandable

- Ensures:
    + Content is clear and readable,
    + Operates in predictable ways,
    + Helps users avoid mistakes.
- Guidelines:
    + __Guideline 3.1__ - make text readable and understandable
    + __Guideline 3.2__ - make web pages appear and operate in predictable ways
    + __Guideline 3.3__ - help isers avoid and correct mistakes


## Robust

- Ensures that content can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents and assitive technologies.
- Guidelines:
    + __Guideline 4.1__ - maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies


## Summary

- The POUR principles help identify which guidelines are important in making specific web content accessibile.
- Each princple expands into specific success criteria.
- Each success criteria has several situations, techniques, and failures to apply.
- Not accessibility guidelines are relevant for all web content.
