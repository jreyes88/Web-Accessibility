# The POUR Principles

There are four principles which categorize the guidelines for web content accessibility, abbreviated as POUR:
- Perceivable
- Operable
- Understandable
- Robust


These principles make it quick to find relevant accessibility guidelines.


The categories can be thought of as a guide to show only the accesibility criteria for specific content.
- *Example* - Making text content accessible does not require meeting the criteria for making video content accessible.


For every guideline there are one or more individual success criteria


Within each success criteria are several situations and techniques describing when the success criteria can be applied.


## Perceivable

The __Perceivable__ principle ensures content isn't just displayed in one way, but that alternative ways to be interpreted are provided such that the user can understand the content.


### Perceivable Guidelines:

- __Guideline 1.1__ - non-text content has a text alternative
- __Guideline 1.2__ - video and audio have accessibility alternatives
- __Guideline 1.3__ - the underlying structure of content is robust and it can be presented in different ways
- __Guideline 1.4__ - the content can be easily separated from the background


*Example* - An image:
- Can only be understood by sighted people.
- Adding a text alternative using the ALT attribute provides a description which can be interpreted in a non-visual way.
- Applicable Guideline = __Guideline 1.1__ - non-text content has a text alternative.
- Applicable Success Criteria = __Success Criteria 1.1.1 Non-text Content__ - all non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose.
    + This specific success criteria does list several situations that are exempt from providing the text alternative, as well as sufficient techniques that pass the success criteria, and known failures.


## Operable

The __Operable__ principle ensures the content can be operated.
- It can be operated from the keyboard as well as the mouse,
- It doesn't cause seizures,
- Waypoints are provided to help users understand where they are in the content.


### Operable Guidelines:
- __Guideline 2.1__ - make all functionality available from a keyboard
- __Guideline 2.2__ - provide users enough time to read and use content
- __Guideline 2.3__ - do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures
- __Guideline 2.4__ - provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are
- __Guideline 2.5__ - users can operate content through a variety of input devices


## Understandable

- Ensures:
    + Content is clear and readable,
    + Operates in predictable ways,
    + Helps users avoid mistakes.
- Guidelines:
    + __Guideline 3.1__ - make text readable and understandable
    + __Guideline 3.2__ - make web pages appear and operate in predictable ways
    + __Guideline 3.3__ - help users avoid and correct mistakes


## Robust

- Ensures that content can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents and assistive technologies.
- Guidelines:
    + __Guideline 4.1__ - maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies


## Summary

- The POUR principles help identify which guidelines are important in making specific web content accessible.
- Each principle expands into specific success criteria.
- Each success criteria has several situations, techniques, and failures to apply.
- Not all accessibility guidelines are relevant for all web content.
