# The Three Levels of Conformance

WCAG 2.1 success criteria has three levels of conformance:
- Level A Conformance
- Level AA Conformance
- Level AAA Conformance


These levels refer to the level of technical complexity needed in their execution, as well as the level of support it provides to users. Working out which level to aim for can be challenging.


To be conformant at a WCAG 2.1 level means implementing the success criterion at that level _and_ the level below.


## Example of Increasing Levels


For this example, let's look at Guideline 2.4, specifically at guidelines and success criteria at all three levels of conformity.


**Guideline 2.4** - Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.
- 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks Level A
- 2.4.2 Page Titled Level A
- 2.4.3 Focus Order Level A
- 2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context) Level A
- 2.4.5 Multiple Ways Level AA
- 2.4.6 Headings and Labels Level AA
- 2.4.7 Focus Visible Level AA
- 2.4.8 Location Level AAA
- 2.4.9 Link Purpose (Link Only) Level AAA
- 2.4.10 Section Headings Level AAA


2.4.1 Bypass Blocks Level A:
- Level A criterion
- A sufficient technique is to implement page links which bypass repeating page content
- Adding links to a page to navigate to named regions is deemed to be very straightforward
- The skip link could be added to a layout page and the change is duplicated on every subsequent page
- The support it provides to a user is helpful


2.4.6 Headings and Labels Level AA:
- Level AA criterion
- A sufficient technique to pass is to provide descriptive page headings
- Implementing this technique may be a little more challenging
- Its scope covers all pages and will involve manually adding headings of altering headings to provide a better description
- The support it provides to user is greater than Level A


2.4.8 Location Level AAA:
- Level AAA criterion
- A sufficient technique to pass is to provide a sitemap
- Browsing websites in a non-visual way can become a large cognitive overhead
- A sitemap assists users by providing a way to navigate to pages more easily and out of sequence
- The support it provides for a user is greater than Level A and Level AA
- However, the implementation of a sitemap over a large website which has many workflows and combinations of workflows is a large technical challenge


## Where to Begin

By choosing greater conformance levels, more users with more diverse and complex disabilities can be accommodated.


The technical challenge to implement the success criteria is often greater.


WCAG 2.1 Level AA conformance success criteria techniques are identified as providing the greatest level of support for users while having a moderate technical impact.


WCAG 2.1 Level AA conformance is the minimum level to aim for.


## Aiming Higher

Adding techniques at a higher conformance level can be useful, but here are some questions to ask before engaging in such an effort:
- How much effort is required to add a success criteria at Level AAA?
- Can more be accomplished by ensuring there is a greater converage of Level AA success criteria rather than trying to incorporate a few Level AAA success criteria techniques?


## Summary

- Conformance levels identify which WCAG 2.1 success criteria to follow
- Choosing success criteria at a higher level will help a greater number of people but is often more difficult to implement
- Level AA criteria is identified as the accepted conformance level worldwide
