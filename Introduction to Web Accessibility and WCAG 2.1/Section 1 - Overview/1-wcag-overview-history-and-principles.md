# WCAG 2.1 Overview, History, and Principles

WCAG stands for Web Content Accessibility Guidelines.

WCAG 2.1 Technical document describes the minimum standard to begin building web content against to achieve accessibility.

## Essential Components of Web Accessibility

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is part of a series of web standards published by the world wide web consortium.
- **Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)**: Explains how to make authoring tools accessible so that people with disabilities can create web content, _and_ help authors create more accessible web content.
    + Includes CMS and WYSIWYG platforms.
- **User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG)**: Explains how to make user agents accessible to people with disabilities. 
    + Includes browsers, browser extensions, media players, readers, and other applications that render web content.
- **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)**: Explains how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Web content generally refers to the information in a web page or web application.
    + Includes:
        * Natural information, such as text, images, and sounds,
        * Code or markup that defines structure, presentation, etc.


## History of Web Accessibility

- _January 1995_: First web accessibility guidelines was published by Gregg Vanderheiden.
- _May 5, 1999_: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) version 1.0 was published, based on unification of various accessibility guidelines written in previous years.
    + WCAG 1.0 consisted of 14 guidelines.
    + Each guideline covered a basic theme of accessibility and one or more checkpoints.
    + Within the 14 guidelines were 65 checkpoints which had a priority rating assigned, describing its impact:
        * Priority 1: Developers **must** satisfy this requirement as one or more groups **will** find it impossibile to access web content
        * Priority 2: Developers **should** implement this requirement as one or more groups **may** find it difficult to access web content
        * Priority 3: Developers **may** implement this requrirement to make it easier for **some** groups to access web content
- _December 11, 2008_: WCAG 1.0 was updated to WCAG 2.0.
    + WCAG 2.0 consisted of 12 guidelines, organised under 4 principles:
        * Perceivabl
        * Operable
        * Understandable
        * Robust
    + In essence, a user can use, operate, and understand a webpage, and the webpage's content is robust on a variety of user agents.
    + WCAG 2.0 uses 3 levels of conformance:
        * Level A: the webpage satisfies **all the Level A Success criteria**
        * Level AA: the webpage satisfies **all the Level A and Level AA criteria**
        * Level AAA: the webpage satisfies **all the Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA criteria**
- _June 5, 2018_: WCAG 2.1 became a W3C recommendation.
    + WCAG 2.1 aims to improve support for three major groups: 
        * Users with cognitive or learning disabilities
        * Users with low vision
        * Users of mobile devices
    + WCAG 2.1 is backwards compatible with WCAG 2.0.
    + WCAG 2.1 has layers of conformance:
        * Four Principles: Provide the foundation for web accessibility
        * Guidelines: Give creators basic goals to work towards
        * Success Criteria: Are testable statements that include granular details to build against
        * Sufficient Techniques: Identified ways to pass a particular criteria
        * Advisory Techniques: Identified ways to improve the users' experience
    + Many countries are adopting WCAG 2.1 as the industry standard.

## Summary

- WCAG 2.1 is one of the essential 3 guidelines for web accessibility.
- WCAG 2.1 is an internationally recognized set of best practices for making web content accessible.
- WCAG 2.1 is made up of four principles, each of which have basic guidelines, and within each guideline are success criteria which act as statements to test against.
