# Choose Accessible Colors

A poor color contrast can affect users with a color vision impairment to discern information. Even if no impairment exists, content viewed in low light or high contrast environments can be difficult to see.


**Choosing a good color contrast benefits everyone.**


The color contrast requirements in the WCAG 2.1 level AA are very confusing to understand:
- Contrast ratios
- Exception clauses
- Large and small text


With differing standards for each of the above, it can be intimidating to put into practice what is acceptable.


**1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) Level AA**

The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for the following:
- Large Text: Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1
- Incidental: Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component, that are pure decoration, that are not visible to anyone, or that are part of a picture that contains significant other visual content, have no contrast requirement
- Logotypes: Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no contrast requirement



Color contrast tools make it very quick to work out acceptable color combinations.


## WCAG 2.1 Satisfaction

- **G18:** Ensuring that a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 exists between text (and images of text) and background behind the text
- **1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum):** The visual presentation of text and images of text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, level AA


## Summary

- An accessible color contrast is crucial for everyone, not just for those users who have impairments
- The WCAG 2.1 AA color contrast success criteria is confusing
