## Describe How the Intersection of Race and Disability Affects Your Life

**Dr. LaMondre Pough**: People say to him, "You're so smart and talented! When I see you, I don't see your disability". But what they're saying is "I don't see a part of you. There's no way you can be smart and talented but still have a disability." That remark is rooted in the concept that there's something wrong or broken about having a disability. But the truth is, that disability *does* come to the table with a disabled person. In order to be able to make a positive change in the world, he needs to show up as a total person, with his smarts, his melanin, and his disability.


**Reyma McCoy McDeid**: Went on a pathway of participating in services to providing services to consulting. Is now in activism. "Why are there people in our society who are so marginalized simply because of who they are and that they need certain services?" What is going on in our society that causes some to have an overabundance of resources and others to have an underabundance of resources? Why are the most marginalized in our society the ones who tend to be in the latter group?


## What is the disability justice movement?

**Reyma**: Think about the disability rights movement, which was informed by, inspired by, and got started shortly after the Black civil rights movement. But rights are about creating space for people that were never intended to inhabit those spaces. When we focus on rights, it's a defensive mode. What can happen in this space to accommodate our existence here, and who do we need to ask to have a position in this space?


*Justice*, on the other hand, is about recognizing that the system was not designed to benefit marginalized (racially or disabled) people, but in order to accommodate and make space for the marginalized, it will need to do things it wasn't designed to do. And the people who the space was built for will feel like they are losing out or under attack. Justice is about asking those difficult questions and being aware that spaces weren't designed for marginalized people. Justice is about asking what we can do moving forward to ensure the spaces we build have room and accommodation for the full spectrum of human existence?


**Lydia X.Z. Brown**: Every single one of us has a moral obligation to use whatever resources we have to challenge and fight violence and oppression in every form. Those resources can fluctuate, and the resources we have access to are dependent on our access to privilege and power. But we all have access to some amount of privilege as well: being able to communicate in written and spoken English, to be seen as articulate, to have a stable internet connection.


Anything beyond a basic, enjoyable life gives us an obligation to fight violence and oppression.


## How has the conversation about disability and race changed since last summer?

**Reyma**: Two years ago there was a lot of discomfort when this conversation would come up. Within the disability community, the push was typically to focus on disability. To focus on other intersections was considered divisive. Then last year happened, and we went from a handful of disability-specific service agencies across the country invoking Black Lives Matter messaging to *every* agency releasing a statement, articulating affirmation that Black Lives Matter and indicating commitments to "doing better" etc.


As mystifying as the disability experience is (even though at 1 in 5 or 1 in 4 people, disabled people represent the largest marginalized group on the planet), the disability experience for racially marginalized people is a complete mystery. This results in major problems with misdiagnoses, wrong diagnoses, non diagnoses, especially in childhood when compared against white disabled peers. This feeds into the prison-industrial complex pipeline, housing insecurity, food insecurity, everything. It all braids together, and you cannot extract race from disability.


## Closing Remarks

**LaMondre**: Recognize that there is a difference. Disability is not a monolith, and those threads of diversity allow for different ways of seeing the world. If we can allow that to shine and lead then we can really progress as a community. Seek to understand those differences because those differences rarely fit into specific frameworks. Engagement without understanding results in chaos. It's important for people with disabilities to be seen outside the disability community.


**Reyma**: We are thinking so small, like how do we make sure that there's room for everyone here? It feels crowded and uncomfortable to people who are used to being at the center of the room. Instead of rehabilitating the old house, let's reinvent ourselves as people. Recognize that everything we interact with on a day to day basis was not built with us in mind. Instead of working to bring marginalized people closer to a default setting, let's get rid of the default setting altogether.


**Lydia**: We are taught to invest in assimilation and conformity to the expectations of white patriarchy. But this is always to the detriment of everyone in queer and trans communities. This community then moves the boundaries of the fences a few inches, but that fence is always exclusionary. Why not tear the fence down? How can we get to the next world where we are all free to live genuine lives in the complexity of our humanity?
